This file will be short as its just how much some peices will cost.

BOARDS
--------------------

Raspberry Pi 5 4GB - 89.99$ (8GB goes over 100$, thats a little much for this project.)
This option is good, but expensive.

Arduino UNO Q 4GB (Dosent go up to 8GB) - 59.00$
Best choice in my opinion, however,
YOU NEED A USB-C TO HDMI PORT ADAPTER. 
This is on the arduino website.


Heatsink Kit - 11.99$
This isnt a board, but this would be nice to have and is kinda needed, just get this if you get any of the 2
boards.

Tiny fan kit - 8.99$
I have regular pc fans, but they are kinda big. These are just easier to use and put around.
This is mainly for quality of life.
