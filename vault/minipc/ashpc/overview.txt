This is the second project im gonna work on, and its going to be much harder then the last.

Okay so heres what i have currently:

A office computer case
A motherboard
A cpu in said motherboard
Ram in said motherboard
And thats all i can think of currently.

The reason i feel like this project is going to be harder is
1. i dont have any money as of writing this,
2. i have never built a computer before,
3. i dont even know if the motherboard will work with the case.

So this is gonna be fun isnt it? But i should get on with it and tell you what ill go over in this project.

1. Parts/Costs
2. Software/Use for computer
and thats about it, short right? i sure hope it will...
